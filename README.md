# RoboMobonobo
RoboMobonobo is a 1 level platformer prototype exploring collectibles, camera functionality, and a "pick up and hold above your head" weapon system, heh.

## Controls
Move : Arrow Keys

Jump : Z

Use : X

You have a double jump!

### Notes
It's not obvious what the objectives are. That's a game design problem I've since worked on. So here's what to do:
* Enter the door to the right to start the level
* Collect the Hats
* Find and collect all the Squids (these might involve platforming challenges)
* Activate the locked-away teleporter and bait the missile launcher into hitting all the targets
* Hit the final target by picking up the Bird-Shot with the X key
* Walk into the end-level door and see your stats!
